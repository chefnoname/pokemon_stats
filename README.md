# A Pokemon Stats App

This is a bootstrapped React application where I display different types of Pokemon.

I leveraged the Material UI component library as its very popular and easy to use.

I implemented an 'endless scroll' where if the user gets to the bottom of the page the API is called to load more random pokemon.

I really enjoyed writing this App - I hope you enjoy using it! :)
